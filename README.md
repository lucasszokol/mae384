Part II
Lucas used Osmond's Part I code ran at a 2 day time-step for the Influenza case. Lucas interpolated the odd days of the simulation using linear and quadratic Lagrange interpolation, and then calculated the EL2 for 
the interpolations for S, I, and R. 

Part III
I have included a writup in PDF form in the folder "Part 3" showing how I manipulated the equations to represent the code.
Lucas commented on the calculation for beta, and worked with Sam to fix the calculation. The 1000 coefficient needed to be outside the parentheses.
